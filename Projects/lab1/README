# Lab 1A: I/O and IPC
## File description
* lab1a.c: Source code of the program
* Makefile: Supports build (default), dist, and clean
* README: Describes the contents of the dist

## Functionalities
* Supports two modes: no argument, and --shell.
  * Run with no argument for a character-at-a-time, full duplex-terminal.
  * Run with --shell argument to create a parent process (terminal) and a forked child process (shell) that pass information back and forth through two unidirectional pipes. The parent process takes in input from both the shell and the keyboard, and the timing of inputs between the shell and keyboard is handled with a main loop that calls poll(2).

## References
* Man pages: kill(2), poll(2), pipe(2), exec(3), wait(2), termios(3), dup(2), waitpid(2), read(2), and write(2).
