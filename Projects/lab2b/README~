QUESTIONS
---------
2.1.1.1) Why doesit take so many iterations before errors are seen?



2.1.1.2) Why does a significantly smaller number of iterations so seldom fail?


2.1.2.1) Why are the --yield runs so much slower?

2.1.2.2) Where is the additional time going?

2.1.2.3) Is it possible to get valid per-operation timings if we are using the --yield option?

2.1.2.4) If so, explain how. If not, explain why not.

2.1.3.1) Why does the average costs per operation drop with increasing iterations?

2.1.3.2) If the cost per iteration is a function of the number of iterations, how do we know how many iterations to run (or what the correct cost is)?
